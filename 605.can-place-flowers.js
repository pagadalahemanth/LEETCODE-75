 * Testcase Example:  '[1,0,0,0,1]\n1'
 *
 * You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some
 * are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
 * 
 * Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty
 * and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return trueÂ if n new flowers can be
 * planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and
 * false otherwise.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 * Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
 * Output: false
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10^4
 * flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
 * There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
 * 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length
 *
